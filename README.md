## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS (CSS Preprocessor)
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Transitions and Animations
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript for form validation and interactivity

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to use **SASS** to structure my CSS more effectively and efficiently. The nested selectors made my styles more readable and maintainable. I also implemented smooth transitions for the button using SASS.

Example of button transition in SASS:

```sass
button
    padding: 1.2rem
    border-radius: 8px
    border: none
    cursor: pointer
    color: #fff
    background-color: $dark-slate-grey
    transition: background-color 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease, transform 0.2s ease

    &:hover
        background: linear-gradient(to right, #FF527B, #FF6A3A)
        box-shadow: 0 16px 24px lighten(#FF6A3A, 10%)
        transform: translateY(-2px)
```

I also implemented form validation logic in JavaScript, dynamically changing the input border and error messages.

Example:

```javascript
if (!emailRegex.test(email.value)) {
  emailInput.classList.add('error-border');
  errorMessage.textContent = 'Please enter a valid email address';
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to focus on:

- Adding animations to success messages for smoother UX.
- Enhancing responsiveness for very small screen sizes.
- Using a CSS framework like **TailwindCSS** or **Bootstrap** to compare workflow speed with SASS.

- [MDN Web Docs - Form Validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - This resource helped me understand how to validate forms in vanilla JavaScript.
- [SASS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - A fantastic guide for getting started with SASS and mastering its syntax.
- [CSS Tricks - Transitions](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/) - Helped me understand smooth transitions in CSS.

### 2. Install SASS globally
If SASS is not installed yet, run:
```bash
npm install -g sass
```

### 3. Compile SASS to CSS
Run the following command in the project folder to compile your SASS file:

```bash
sass --watch style.sass style.css
